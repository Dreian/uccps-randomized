# UCCPS Randomized algorithms

Material for the [Almost Certainly Correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01fadBZC04) talk organised by UCCPS.

The two `.cpp` source files are solutions to the array search problem: the first
line of the input are the length of the array and a percentage `p`, and the
second line contains a whitespace-separated array; the output is a value that
appears in `p%` of the locations if such a value exists, or `-1` if it doesn't.
